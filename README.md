## General info

This is my first project using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM. Part of my process as a self-taught front-end developer is to understand the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS prior to utilizing frameworks. As such, this project only uses the languages for web development; there are no frameworks used. The project serves as a means of applying abstract concepts derrived from books such as Eloquent JavaScript 3rd Edition and Learning JavaScript 3rd Edition. Additonally, this project focuses on creating a functional shopping cart, so I did not utilize the mobile-first approach. The shopping cart contains the following functionalities:

- Adds product(s) to cart when clicking on 'Add to Cart' button
- 'Add to Cart' button changes to 'In Cart' when clicked
- Image, product name, price, quantity, increase/decrease buttons, and a remove item button appears in the cart
- Decreasing item quantity below 1 will remove product from the cart
- Displays total price and is adjusted when increasing/decreasing quantity in cart
- Clear Cart button removes all products from the cart
- 'In Cart' button changes back to 'Add to Cart' when products are removed
- Products in cart are saved in local storage, so progress will not be lost when refreshing the page
- Checkout button displays an alert with a thank you message and refreshes the page and local memory

This project was inspired by WebDev.Tube by Adrian Bienias. His tutorial can be found at https://webdev.tube/ and is part of his Frontend Developer Path lectures. Users will be able to sign up for a 30-day trial, and will subsequently have access to one full course. The course I chose is 'Real World Shopping Cart Project with Pure Javascript.'
